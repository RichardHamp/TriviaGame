# TriviaGame aka: Pour Me Another Trivia

Basic trivia game pertaining to all things boozy. Enjoy a drink and play a game.

# How To Play:

You will be asked five questions. Click on the answer you believe is correct. On a correct answer you will automatically move on to the next question. On an incorrect answer, the correct answer will be shown (with the game making fun of you a bit first) and then you'll move on to the next question. At the end, the number of correct and incorrect answers will be shown as well as any you timed out on.
